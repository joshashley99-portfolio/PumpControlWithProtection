Please note that some of my IO is a bit nonstandard, this was done intentionally for testing/demo purposes in a simulated environment. In a real-world application, hardware mapping and I/O configuration would follow standard conventions.

For better understanding of how system operations should work, please view the Project Description pdf or watch the operations demo.  Also feel free to review the ladder logic pdfs and download the .rss files, but be aware the .rss files may not open properly in programs other than Logix500.
